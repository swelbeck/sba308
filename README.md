# SBA 308: JavaScript Fundamentals

## Project Description

This script takes in course data, assignment data and Learner submission data to return an array of objects grouped by Learner.

Each object in the output contains the Learner's ID number, their average score, and an individual score for each assignment. The scores account for late submissions and does not include assignments whose due dates are in the future.

## How to run

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the `script.js` file in a code editor.
3. Modify the `CourseInfo`, `AssignmentGroup`, and `LearnerSubmissions` data, if desired.
   - The data entries are provided at the top of the `script.js` file.
4. Run the getLearnerData() to see output.
